        <h3>Kei cars are very popular in Japan because they are inexpensive â€“ about half the price of a Prius, they get the same fuel economy as a Prius, they are very practical and roomy, they are easy to park in crowded Japan, and they have lower taxes and licensing costs.  Women make up approximately 65% of the owners, and in some Prefectures, 99% of households own one, often as a second car.  They are more popular in rural areas as compared to a big city like Tokyo, where it is more convenient to take public transit and owning a car is not as necessary as a more rural area.
